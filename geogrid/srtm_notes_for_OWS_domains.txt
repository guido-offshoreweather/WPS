AND_ARW_Operational is NOT using SRTM 15sec topography
The SRTM_FAIL file has the paths to the SRTM data included
but the domain seg-faults when trying to use it


The standard topography AND_GEOGRID file does NOT include the paths
to the SRTM data BUT to keep the filename pattern the same, it DOES
have SRTM in the filename so that auto_wrf doesn't fail
